#### Problem

A positive integer N is given. The goal is to construct the shortest possible sequence of integer ending with N, using the following rules:

  - The first element of the sequence is 1; more specifically: `A[0] = 1`,
  - Each of the following elements is generated by multiplying the previous elements by 2 or increasing it by 1: more precisely: `A[i] = A[i-1] * 2` or `A[i] = A[i-1] + 1`, for `i >= 1`

For example, for `N = 18`, the shortest sequence is:
```
A[0] = 1
A[1] = 2
A[2] = 4
A[3] = 8
A[4] = 9
A[5] = 18
```

##### Write a function:   
`function solution(N);`   
that, given a positive integer `N`, returns the length of the shortest possible sequence of integers satisfying the above conditions and ending with `N`.  
For example, given `N = 18`, the function should return `6`, as explained above.  
##### Assume that:   

   - `N` is an integer within the range `[1..2,147,483,647]`

##### Complexity:

   - Expected worst-case time complexity is `O(log(N))`
   - Expected worst-case space complexity is `O(1)`
